                This guitar takes the same shape as the world renowned <em>Gipson Les Paul</em>, but at a much much cheaper price.
                This guitar comes in at around €200 and is thought to be an all around brilliant guitar. The downsides are, like any electric guitar,
                you will need an amp to be able to utilise this instrument. You can check it out at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Epiphone-Paul-100-Electric-Heritage-Sunburst/dp/B0002CZUTW?tag=guitarfcom05-21">

                This, on the otherhand, is an acoustic guitar, that has received rave reviews and not only has exceptional sound quality, but only costs around €90. Therefore I personally would recommend this
                if you are on the market for an acoustic guitar. You can check it out at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RA-090-Dreadnought-Acoustic-Guitar-Black/dp/B005PFPNIO?tag=guitarfcom-20">
