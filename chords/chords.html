                            The first chord we will cover will be the 'G' Chord.
                            Put your first finger on the 'B' string in the second fret,
                            put your second finger on string 'E'(thick) on the third fret,
                            finally put your third finger on the 'E'(thin) string on the
                            third fret. Refer to the diagram above. Using the 1-2-3-4
                            strumming pattern we covered earlier, play the G chord with
                            down strokes in the 1-2-3-4 pattern until you feel a bit more
                            comfortable.

                          To play the 'D' chord is played by putting your first finger on the 'G' sting of the second fret, then you place your second finger on the 'E'(thin)
                          of the second fret, then finally place your third finger on the 'B' string of the third fret, holding that position stumb the 1-2-3-4 downstrokes stumming pattarn
                          we covered earlier, repeat this until it becomes natural.

                        <p>
                          To play the 'A' Chord you must place your first finger on the 'D' string on the second fret. Next, place your second finger on the 'G' string also on the second fret,
                          finally place your third finger on the 'B' string and again on the second fret, holding that position strum the 1-2-3-4 downstrokes strumming pattern
                          we covered earlier and rerun until adequate.

                        <p>
                          In order to learn to play the 'F' chord you must have the previous chords well practised as it's slightly more challenging on
                          the fingers. First you must hold down the 'B' and 'E'(thin) with your first finger (yes both of them!). Next, place your second
                          finger on the 'G' string and your third on the 'D' string. Now strum to your hearts content, and of course, continuing to use the 1-2-3-4 downstrokes strumming pattern
                          we covered earlier. Rehearse until you've reached a satisfactory standard.

                          To play this chord you must first place your first finger on 'E'(thin) in the second fret. Next, place your second finger on the 'D' string in the fourth fret
                          and put the third finger on the 'G' string on the fourth fret. Again, put your fourth finger on the 'B' string on the fourth fret, and while holding that position, strum the 1-2-3-4 downstrokes strumming pattern
                          we covered earlier. Repeat this until it becomes more comfortable.
